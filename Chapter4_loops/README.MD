# Loops

## While loop

A while loops repeats the code while a condition remains true.

A while loop is displayed as 
while(condition) {
  //code running while the condition is true. The code here is called the `body`.
}

## For loop

A for loop is based on the variable updated in the body.

A for loop works like this
for (initialization; condition; final expression) {
  // code to run while the condition is true.
}

> Initialization only happens once, when the code first kicks off. It's often used to set the initial value of the variable associated to the loop condition.

> The condition is evaluated once before the loop runs each time. If it's true, the code runs. If not, the code doesn't run.

> The final expression is evaluated after the loop runs each time. It's often used to update the value of the variable associated with the loop condition, as we saw in the previous example.
